The term "bug", used to describe an error in a computer program, actually dates back to 1947 when Grace Hopper, a computer scientist and U.S. Navy rear admiral, was working on the Harvard Mark II computer when she discovered a moth trapped in a relay, causing a malfunction. She removed the moth and taped it to the computer's logbook with the notation "First actual case of bug being found." From then on, the term "bug" was used to describe any issue or glitch in a computer system.
